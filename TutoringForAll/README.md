# TutoringForAll
## Native Android Application

Creating an app to help tutors reach more audience.

1. Separate tutor profile: Tutors can register on the app providing with details such as :
-qualification
-teaching experience
-subjects
-offline/online teaching
-fee
-availability of home tutions/coaching 

2. Students profile: Students can look up for a list of tutors specific to their city, grade and subjects.

This will help deserving tutors reach a wider audience, and students to find good mentors.
